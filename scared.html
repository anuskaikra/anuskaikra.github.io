Try to identify warning signs that you are starting to get annoyed. When you recognize the signs, step away from the situation or try relaxation techniques to prevent your irritation from escalating. Improve your communication skills. People often jump to conclusions when they are angry, and they can say the first mean thing that they can think of. Try to stop and listen before reacting. Then take time to think carefully about how you want to reply. If you need to step away to cool down before continuing the conversation, make a promise to come back later to finish the discussion. You can nott completely eliminate angry feelings. But you can make changes to the way those events affect you, and the ways in which you respond. If you need to step back from a situation, do that by listening to calming music (as curated for you) or watch a comedy movie. By making the effort to keep your anger in check, you and the people close to you will be happier for the long run. ";
