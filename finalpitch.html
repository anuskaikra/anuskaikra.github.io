        <h2> How are you feeling today? </h2>
    

    
        <h3> For my final project, I will be attempting to create an interactive page. The first page will be a "remote" with buttons asking about your feelings for the day. (excited, sad, angry, happy, etc...) Once your choose your emotion, a custom advice log will come out. With the pop up with the advice, a currated playlist will begin to play and resources/links to sites to help you deal with your feelings and emotions will be available.  </h3>
