Typically, what causes you to emotionally overreact are beliefs that are exaggerated or distorted. Is what you are upset about reversible? If not, is it inevitable? Ask yourself why you are having such a hard time with this. Look for Positives. You can alleviate your emotional distress if you stop focusing on your immediate experience of hurt and get yourself to re-focus on whatever positives might come out of what just transpired. Its crucial to understand what you might learn from this experience that could help you in the future. Practice self-care. If you need to cry it out, then do that. If you need a day to relax, try to carve out time to do so. If you need to listen to sad songs to help you feel it, then do that. Sometimes life does not allow you to take days and weeks to get over something. You need to do that while still living your life. This can mean listening to self-help podcasts, upbeat playlists, and anything else you can think of.";
