            <p>Through dialogue with Julie, I have also been able to gain a deeper understanding on why this amendment needs to be altered. This understanding is prompting the creation of surveys for Fordham undergraduate students. The surveys will include simple questions asking how much they know about this amendment, if anything at all. In researching this amendment, I had also realized that I lacked a lot of information about it, as many of my peers have. </p>

            <p>Many students are unaware of the need for social justice and social action. Whether it is a wider topic or a more specific cause, the first steps need to be taken in order to foster these ideas with our peers.</p>

            <p>Julie has also emphasized that their organization is a catalyst for change at Fordhams institution, as well. Fordham University does not have any organization or space for criminal justice reform. There are currently no classes and no formats of education being offered to students who may benefit from it. Other institutions, such as Columbia University, have classes on reentry, reintegration, and community engagement practice. Fordhams lack thereof is contributing to the role that it is playing, which ultimately shows a lack of care for greater issues outside the campus. </p>

            <p>We already know that this is one of the countries in the world that have not made an effort to make some type of adjustments to the principle, the law that governed this country in light of this new discovery or in light of changed opinions about what is actually going on in the country.</p>

            <p>Julie has shared this as one of the quotes within the lecture held at Fordham to reflect on the needed improvements needed for our justice system. Sparking debate and dialogue is one of the first steps that need to be taken in order to cultivate growth in our communities. Without the resources that give us access to this knowledge, we can not just expect people to care for a cause. There needs to be connections and presentations made for students to support a greater issue.
