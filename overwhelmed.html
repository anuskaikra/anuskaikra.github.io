To prevent future feelings of overwhelm, it is often helpful to consider your current workload and list of responsibilities. Write your schedule down and allocate time to only focus on what needs to be done. Pushback on what is making you feel overwhelmed. Stop telling yourself that you are failing at something and complete it with your all instead. Sometimes the hardest part is just starting, so write down a list of ideas or words of encouragement that may help you start your project. Moments of extreme overwhelm are not always the best times to bust out heart pumping cardio moves. Instead, focus instead on soothing, low impact activities.If you are able to, take a step away from whatever is overwhelming you, whether it is work, a text message, a conversation with your partner, or another trigger, and try low impact, highly restorative activities like yoga, listening to music and podcasts, going for a walk, or even watering your plants.";
