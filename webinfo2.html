            <h2> John Berger : Ways of Seeing Things </h2>
            <article>
                <section>
                       <p> John Berger uses art to describe different phenomenons and introduce various introspective ideas to examine the ways of seeing. In such images and ideas, Berger shows the representation of art today vs art when it was first created. As he describes old art, he speaks on the meaning of art. Painting now are able to replicated and mass produced. Is the meaning behind the paintings the same as they were when they were first created? Probably not. The production of art has changed and the access to it has changed as well. The same piece of art will mean completely differently from one person to the next.

                     <p> Art often has the view that is a luxury. Art is expensive because people pay money to purchase it. John Berger describes the love of art to be "sublime," which I would agree with. People have taken the interest in art and have found a grandiose nature about it. Art is not only viewed as an interest, but it is usually seen as something that is extremely notable.
