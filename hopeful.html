That might start with individual activities or self-care practices but will and should involve participating in genuine, healthy relationships as well. Lean in on the authentic connections you have. Having relationships with people in which you feel safe enough to have open, vulnerable conversations about what you’re dealing with—and being able to work through those feelings together in a productive way. If you are looking to be hopeful or are already hopeful, share these thoughts with the people who want the best for you. Remember that you are the master of your own life. Being hopeful relies partly on having a sense of control; it is the idea that  you can influence on the world around you and that the actions you take can have positive consequences in your life.";
