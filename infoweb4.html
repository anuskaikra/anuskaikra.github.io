         Vannevar Bushs article, As We May Think, goes into the detail about the evolution of machines and the impact of human memory. She opens the article describing a machine that records all our records and communications, likening it to the human mind. Science has allowed the evolution of greater works to mimic tools that we have been using for centuries. There is a precision that comes with the ease of life, but that precision also allows lines to become blurred. Our personal recollections are accompanied by videos and images. It has aided in the speed and flexibility of memories, but the ease in this can also be argued has allowed people to rely on technological developments for activities instead of using just a little more mental strength.

The future of the web in action is characterized as open data, social machines, web science, and free bandwidth. This becomes a great development for us and will continue to. The article emphasizes that with the introduction of the internet, world wide web, life without will no longer be possible. The world has become so reliant on it and it allows for the advancement of so much. It allows for the larger volume of freedom of speech and the spread of information with no way of stopping it essentially.
