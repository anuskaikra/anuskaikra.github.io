          Scott McCloud's Understanding Comics gives insight into the interpretations of comics. Often times, comics are perceived in a certain way (i.e. childish, immature, not art) because people have a narrow perception of it. His attempt to undermine these narrow and frankly, negative, perceptions is something that can be read well by most people. He uses his own use of comics to explain comics. He desrcibes comics in a way that gives the brings the notion of sophistacation to it.

             The art of comics is not an easy mastery. It is something we can experience and view everyday because it is essentially all around us. Comics, generally, are also drawn images, different shadings, animation, and etc. The continuation of the repeated misunderstanding of comics should be eradicated as so much of art and history come from it. The love for comics, among many children, start from watching television shows. These shows range from old to new. The animation over time has progressed and so has the art of comics. The origin of comics dates even before that. The writer compares it to heiroglyphics and ancient messages. As time has progressed, so has the modes of communication. Yet, art remains one of them to this day.

    McCloud draws the comparison of comics to a blank slate. As he tells his interpretation on comics, he shares the significance of keeping the faces vague. This allows the readers to detach from the messenger and rather, approach the message in their own way. This is the exact art that goes into comics as it allows the readers to build their OWN connection.
