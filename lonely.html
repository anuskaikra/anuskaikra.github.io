Blaming yourself for how you feel is never skillful, productive, or kind. Many things come together in your life to create this painful feeling. It is not your fault.

We can find solace in many things that ease the pain of loneliness. Experiment and see what helps you feel better.Help someone in need. Helping others eases loneliness because it makes us be less self-focused. It could be an elderly neighbor or someone on social media  who might benefit from a supportive comment. ";
